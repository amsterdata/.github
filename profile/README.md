Research on [responsible data management](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3488717) for machine learning at the University of Amsterdam (as part of INDELab/IRLab). Checkout our recent and ongoing projects:
 
 * __[mlinspect](https://github.com/amsterdata/mlinspect)__ allows the instrumentation and inspection of native ML pipelines written in Python with pandas, sklearn and keras. Details are available in our paper on [Data Distribution Debugging in Machine Learning Pipelines](https://ssc.io/pdf/mlinspect-journal.pdf) from the special issue on data science for responsible data management of the VLDB Journal.
 
 * __[serenade](https://github.com/amsterdata/serenade)__ is a low-latency session-based recommender system deployed in production at [bol.com](https://bol.com), the largest e-commerce platform in the Netherlands. Details are available in our paper on [Low-Latency Session-Based Recommendation in e-Commerce at Scale](https://ssc.io/pdf/modds003.pdf) from SIGMOD'22.
 
 * __[snapcase](https://github.com/amsterdata/snapcase)__ contains differential implementations of state-of-the-art kNN models for sequential recommendation which can "unlearn" user data in milliseconds. 

 * __[jenga](https://github.com/amsterdata/jenga)__ is an experimentation library that allows data science practititioners and researchers to study the effect of common data corruptions (e.g., missing values, broken character encodings) on the prediction quality of their ML models. Details are available in our paper on [A Framework to Study the Impact of Data Errors on the Predictions of Machine Learning Models](https://ssc.io/pdf/modds003.pdf) from EDBT'21.
