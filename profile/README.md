Research on data management for machine learning at the University of Amsterdam (as part of INDELab/IRLab). Checkout our recent and ongoing projects:
 
 * __[mlinspect](github.com/amsterdata/mlinspect)__ allows the instrumentation and inspection of native ML pipelines written in Python with pandas, sklearn and keras. Details are available in our paper on [Data Distribution Debugging in Machine Learning Pipelines](https://ssc.io/pdf/mlinspect-journal.pdf) from the special issue on data science for responsible data management of the VLDB Journal.
 
 * __[serenade](github.com/amsterdata/serenade)__ is a low-latency session-based recommender system deployed in production at [bol.com](https://bol.com), the largest e-commerce platform in the Netherlands. Details are available in our paper on [Low-Latency Session-Based Recommendation in e-Commerce at Scale](https://ssc.io/pdf/modds003.pdf) from SIGMOD'22.
 
 * __[snapcase](github.com/amsterdata/snapcase)__ contains differential implementations of state-of-the-art kNN models for sequential recommendation which can "unlearn" user data in milliseconds.
