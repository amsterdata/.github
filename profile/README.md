Research on **data management for machine learning** at the University of Amsterdam (as part of INDELab). Checkout our recent and ongoing projects:
 
 * __[mlinspect](https://github.com/amsterdata/mlinspect)__ allows the instrumentation and inspection of native ML pipelines written in Python with pandas, sklearn and keras. 
 
 * __[serenade](https://github.com/amsterdata/serenade)__ is a low-latency session-based recommender system deployed in production at [bol.com](https://bol.com), the largest e-commerce platform in the Netherlands. 
 
 * __[snapcase](https://github.com/amsterdata/snapcase)__ contains differential implementations of state-of-the-art kNN models for sequential recommendation which can "unlearn" user data in milliseconds. 

 * __[jenga](https://github.com/amsterdata/jenga)__ is an experimentation library that allows data science practititioners and researchers to study the effect of common data corruptions (e.g., missing values, broken character encodings) on the prediction quality of their ML models.
